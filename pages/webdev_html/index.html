                    In this lesson I learned the basics of html and also learned about installation of git, node js and vs code and also learned few command prompt keyword.
                    the challeging part of this activity for me is the installation of required softwares because i am unfamiliar with the terms used.
                    overall, the actual html activity was fun and not so difficult thanks to my prior experience.

                    In both these activities I learned more about html and it's many siynatax like tables, images, hyperlinks and many more. 
                    I think the challenging part of these activties is following the instructions since sometimes the instructions are confusing due to my lack on knowledege. 
                    and my overall impression for this activity is that it was fun and challeging at the same time
